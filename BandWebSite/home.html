					This is site about trash metal band called Metallica. The band was formed in 1981 by drummer Lars Ulrich and vocalist/guitarist
					James Hetfield. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big
					four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding
					members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine
					(who formed Megadeth) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.
