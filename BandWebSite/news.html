            <h3>METALLICA's ROBERT TRUJILLO: 'JAMES HETFIELD Is One Of The Best Drummers In The World… On His Guitar'</h3>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="text short-parag">
        <p>In a recent interview with Polar Music Prize, bassist Robert Trujillo, who joined METALLICA in 2003, was asked what influences he adds and brings to the group.
            He responded: "In order to play in this band, you've gotta have [the edge and the attitude]; that's one of the most important things.
            You can be an incredible player, but when you get onstage, you've gotta be yourself and you've gotta bring it, as we say, and that just means give 120 percent.
            'Cause it is a gig that requires a lot of energy,
            and there's an intensity in the music that sort of carries you through the show and turns you into maybe somebody that you aren't normally in your day-to-day casual existence.
            So that's a lot of fun. But at the same time, there's a groove factor. And I also go back to [groundbreaking jazz bassist] Jaco Pastorius, because it was always about the groove.
            So no matter what he was playing, whether it was a ballad or a bebop song or something really funky, there was always the groove. And it's the same thing in METALLICA."
            He continued: "I always say James Hetfield is one of the best drummers in the world — on his guitar,
            because he is really a groove machine with that instrument. And it's an unusual combination of players, but it works.

            <h3>Metallica to Receive Music's 'Nobel Prize'</h3>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="text short-parag">
        <p>Nearly 40 years into their career, Metallica will receive the Polar Music Prize – an equivalent award to the Nobel Prize – this coming spring.
            The award recognizes international excellence in music. The group will receive an award of one million Swedish kronor, roughly equivalent to $126,000.
            The band will donate the money to its own All Within My Hands organization, which aids communities in need with workforce education, food-bank donations and other local services.

            <h3>Metallica's James Hetfield to Make Film Debut in Ted Bundy Movie</h3>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="text short-parag">
        <p>James Hetfield will make his big-screen acting debut in the upcoming Ted Bundy film Extremely Wicked, Shocking Evil and Vile, starring Zac Efron as the infamous serial killer.
            The Metallica singer will portray Officer Bob Hayward,
            "a no-nonsense Utah highway patrol veteran who was the first law enforcement officer to arrest Bundy in 1975
            after pulling the killer over and discovering burglary tools in his car but wisely suspecting much worse,"
            the film announced Monday.
